My objective with this project, developed on Jstack course, was learning some key concepts of Node.js and back end development like:

- Usage of express to create Api Rest
- Usage of development patterns like Repository Pattern
- Usage of middleware to cors access control
- Usage of middleware to handle with errors
- Creation of Postgres database
- Usage of Postgres database on API

# DATABASE

install yarn and packages and change the enviroment variables to your backend, frontend and database ports if you need

feel free to use this project to study and testing.
